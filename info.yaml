  description:  "A Tiny Hardware Authentication Engine that generates a 4-digit OTP using a 16-bit LFSR with time-bound validity and multi-attempt lockout. The design is lightweight, Tiny Tapeout friendly, and observable on FPGA using LEDs and 7-segment displays."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     50000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_tiny_hardware_authentication_engine"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
