## How it works

This project implements a **4-digit One-Time Password (OTP) authentication system** in digital logic.  
An internal **16-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** continuously generates a pseudo-random 4-digit OTP.  
A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** handles user input, compares it with the LFSR OTP, and decides the system status.

1. The **LFSR** generates a 16-bit (4-digit) OTP.
2. The **user** enters each 4-bit digit sequentially via `user_in[3:0]`.
3. After each digit entry, the **`user_latch`** signal is pulsed to register the digit.
4. Once all four digits are entered, the FSM checks the complete OTP:
   - ✅ **U (Unlocked):** Correct OTP entered  
   - ❌ **L (Locked):** Incorrect OTP or maximum attempts reached  
   - ⏰ **E (Expired):** OTP timed out
5. Display:
   - **Right 4 digits:** User-entered OTP  
   - **Left 4 digits:** Toggle every 2 seconds between  
     - LFSR-generated OTP  
     - Status message `"A#-X"` (Attempt number and result)

The **pos_edge** detectors ensure clean button press registration for `otp_latch` and `user_latch`.

## How to test

1. **Reset / Power on** the system – a new OTP is generated by the LFSR.
2. Observe the **left 4 seven-segment displays** showing the current OTP.
3. **Enter your OTP attempt:**
   - Use `user_in[3:0]` to set each 4-bit digit (0–9).
   - Pulse `user_latch` high for one clock to confirm each digit.
4. After all 4 digits are entered:
   - FSM verifies OTP and shows the result on the left display (`A#-L`, `A#-U`, or `A#-E`).
5. The display toggles automatically every **2 seconds** between OTP and status view.
6. Repeat with new inputs or reset the system for a new OTP.



## External hardware

| Component | Description | Purpose |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **8× Seven-Segment Display** | Common anode/cathode, connected to `lfsr_out`, `user_out`, and `an` | Displays the 4-digit OTP and user input |
| **Push Buttons / Switches** | Connected to `user_latch` and `otp_latch` | For digit entry and OTP latch confirmation |
| **Clock (50 MHz)** | Onboard or external | System timing source |
| **Reset Button** | Connected to `reset` | Initializes and regenerates OTP |

> **Note:** In Tiny TapeOut simulation, the seven-segment display outputs can be observed via waveform instead of actual LEDs.
